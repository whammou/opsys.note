*Containerization:*
- Containerization if a process of packaging your application together with its dependencies into one package
- That can then be run almost *anywhere*, regardless of whether in the cloud, or a developer's laptop
- By abstracting the infrastructure, containerization allow user to make the application truly portable and flexible

*** Containers vs. Virtual Machines
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
=containers= and =virtual machines= are very similar resource virtualization technologies.
#+END_QUOTE

*Virtualisation:*
- is the process in which a system singular resource /RAM, CPU, DISK/ can be /virtualised/ and represented as multiple resources
-----
*Key differences:*
- =virtual-machine= virtualise an entire machine down to the hardware layers
- =containers= only virtualises software layers above the operating system level

**** Containers in-depth
Containers are lightweight software =packages= that contain all the =dependencies= required to execute the contained =software= application
- =dependecies= include things like system =libraries=, external third party code =packages=, and other system level =applications=
- The =depencies= included in a container exist in stack levels that are higher than the =os=
**** Virtual-machines in-depth
=virtual-machines= are heavy software packages that provide a complete emulation of low level hardware like /CPU, DISK, NETWORK/. =virtual-machine= may also include a complementary software =packages= combined produce a fully function snapshot of a computational system
