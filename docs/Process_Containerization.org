*Containerization:*
- Containerization if a process of packaging your application together with its dependencies into one package
- That can then be run almost *anywhere*, regardless of whether in the cloud, or a developer's laptop
- By abstracting the infrastructure, containerization allow user to make the application truly portable and flexible

*** Containers vs. Virtual Machines
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
=containers= and =virtual machines= are very similar resource virtualization technologies.
#+END_QUOTE

*Virtualisation:*
- is the process in which a system singular resource /RAM, CPU, DISK/ can be /virtualised/ and represented as multiple resources
-----
*Key differences:*
- =virtual-machine= virtualise an entire machine down to the hardware layers
- =containers= only virtualises software layers above the operating system level
[[https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:92adde69-f728-4cfc-8bab-ba391c25ae58/SWTM-2060_Diagram_Containers_VirtualMachines_v03.png][virtual-machine vs. Container system level]]
**** Containers in-depth
Containers are lightweight software =packages= that contain all the =dependencies= required to execute the contained =software= application
- =dependecies= include things like system =libraries=, external third party code =packages=, and other system level =applications=
- The =depencies= included in a container exist in stack levels that are higher than the =os=
***** Popular Container Providers
- *Docker:* \\
  =docker= is the most popular and widely used container runtime. =docker hub= is a giant public repository of popular containerized software and applications. Containers on =docker hub= can instantly downloaded and deployed to local =docker runtime=
  -----
- *CRI-O:* \\
  =cri-o= is an implementation of the /Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI)/ that allows the use of /Open Container Initiative (OCI)/ com
-----
- *Podman:* \\
  open-source alternative of =docker=, comes with integration for =systemd= and =kubernetes=
**** Virtual-machines in-depth
=virtual-machines= are heavy software packages that provide a complete emulation of low level hardware like /CPU, DISK, NETWORK/. =virtual-machine= may also include a complementary software =packages= combined produce a fully function snapshot of a computational system
**** Containers vs. Pods
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
While both =containers= and =pods= play essential roles in /containerized/ deployments, They serve distinct purpose \\
#+END_QUOTE

-----
*Isolation vs. cohesion:* \\
- =containers= are designed for isolation, providing a self-contained environment for a single application. Each =container= has its own set of resources and dependencies, ensuring it runs independently without impacting other =containers=
+ =pod=, on other hand, promote cohesion. They group multiple =containers= that need to work together tightly, facilitating communication and resource sharing between them
-----
*Abstraction level:* \\
- =container= has a /lower/ abstraction level. They focus on single application and its =dependencies= -> providing a consistent execution environment across different platforms
+ =pod= offers a /higher/ abstraction level. They manage a group of =container= as a single unit -> simplifying /deployment, scaling, and life cycle management/ of a complex application
-----
*Communication and resource sharing:* \\
- =container= typically communicate with each other over network using mechanism like inter-container networking <- They generally don't share resources directly unless configured to do so
+ =pods= in contrast, enable seamless communication and resource sharing between =containers= <- They can communicate directly using =localhost= and share =storage volume=, allowing multiple =containers= to access the same persistent data
-----
*Lifetime management:* \\
- =containers= are typically /short-lived/ -> they are create and destroyed on demand
+ =pods= can configured to have a specific /lifetime/ or /life-cycle/ -> Even if one =container= within a =pod= fails or restarts, the other =containers= in the =pod= can continue running depending on the pod's /configuration/
***** Use Cases of Containers
- *Micro-services architecture*
- *Application deployment and Scaling*
- *CI/CD*
- *Legacy application modernisation*
- *Batch Processing*
- *Developing and testing cloud-native applications*
***** Use Cases of Pods
- *Multi-container applications*
- *Managing complex applications*
- *Stateful applications*
- *Sidecar containers*
- *Graceful degradation and self-healing*
***** Choosing Between Container vs. Pod
*Application architecture:* \\
- =containers= are a natural fir if your application is built using =microservies acrchitecture= /Where each service runs independently/
+ =pods= are the way to go for applications with multiple interdependent =containers=. =Pods= provide a cohesive unit for managing these containers
-----
*Scalability Requirements:* \\
- =container= prefer application that priorities /fine-grained/ control or /scaling/ individual components
+ =pods= are more suitable for applications where multiple =containers= need to be scaled together to maintain functionality
-----
*Communication and Resource Sharing Needs:* \\
- =container= are sufficient if the application consists of loosely coupled serves that communicate primarily over a network
+ =pods= for applications where =containers= need to share resources or communicate frequently
-----
*Application Complexity:* \\
- =containers= for straightforward applications with sing unit container
+ =pods= are ideal for complex application with multiple interdependent =containers=
